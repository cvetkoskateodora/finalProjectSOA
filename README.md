The blog application is a full-stack web application that aims to provide bloggers with a
user-friendly platform to create, manage, and share their blog posts. The application
leverages the power of ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend and Angular for the
frontend, creating a robust and scalable solution.

Technologies used:

ASP.NET Core Web API: The backend of the application will be built using ASP.NET
Core Web API. It provides a powerful and efficient framework for building RESTful
APIs, handling HTTP requests, and managing data persistence.

Angular: The frontend of the application will be developed using Angular, a popular
JavaScript framework for building dynamic and responsive web applications. Angular
offers a comprehensive set of tools and components for creating a rich user interface,
handling user interactions, and rendering data from the backend.

Entity Framework Core: Entity Framework Core is utilized for data modelling and
database access in the application. With Entity Framework Core, developers can
define data models, perform database migrations, and query the database using LINQ
(Language Integrated Query) syntax.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Alongside Angular, standard web technologies like HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript are used to build the frontend user interface. HTML is used for
creating the structure of web pages, CSS is used for styling and layout, and JavaScript
is used for enhancing interactivity and implementing dynamic features.
